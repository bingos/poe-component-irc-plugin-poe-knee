DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::POE::Knee, is a POE::Component::IRC plugin
    that runs Acme::POE::Knee style horse races on IRC channels using the
    channel member list to generate the POE::Knees. >:)

CONSTRUCTOR
    new Creates a new plugin object. You may specify the following optional
        parameters:

          'stages' => the number of stages involved in the race, default is 5;

IRC INPUT
    POEKNEE
        If your bot is addressed by name with the command 'POEKNEE' (case
        doesn't matter), with optional number of stages, a POE::Knee race is
        started.

          GumbyBRAIN: POEKNEE 10

OUTPUT
    Apart from the output seen on the IRC channel where a POE::Knee is
    currently underway, at the end of a race the following 'irc' event is
    generated.

    irc_poeknee_results
        Generated each time a POE::Knee race finishes.

          ARG0, the channel where the race was run;
          ARG1, an arrayref containing lots of potentially uninteresting data;
